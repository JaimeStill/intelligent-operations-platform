## Operating System

I've transitioned from Windows to Linux. Initially, I was operating on an Ubuntu-based distribution of Linux, but have recently switched to [Omarchy](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/91/welcome-to-omarchy). It is a distribution based on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and the tiling window manager [Hyprland](https://hypr.land/). See [Omarchy 2.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcHY0AEd2Uw) for an overview of Omarchy and why it is a great leap forward in personal computing not just for developers, but for everyone.
